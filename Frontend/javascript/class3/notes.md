Switch case:
switch (expression) { case value1: // Code to be executed if expression equals value1 break; case value2: // Code to be executed if expression equals value2 break; // Add more cases as needed default: // Code to be executed if no cases match }

Example:-
switch (new Date) { case 0: day = "Sunday"; break; case 1: day = "Monday"; break; case 2: day = "Tuesday"; break; case 3: day = "Wednesday"; break; case 4: day = "Thursday"; break; case 5: day = "Friday"; break; case 6: day = "Saturday"; }

Operator
1. Arithmetic Operators
Used for basic mathematical operations.

(Addition)
(Subtraction)
(Multiplication) / (Division) % (Modulus) ** (Exponentiation)
Example
let sum = 5 + 3; // 8 let product = 5 * 3; // 15 let power = 2 ** 3; // 8

2. Assignment Operators
Used to assign values to variables.

= (Assign) += (Add and assign) -= (Subtract and assign) *= (Multiply and assign) /= (Divide and assign) %= (Modulus and assign)

Example
let x = 10; x += 5; // x is now 15

3. Comparison Operators
Used to compare two values.

== (Equal to) === (Strict equal to) != (Not equal to) !== (Strict not equal to)

(Greater than) < (Less than) = (Greater than or equal to) <= (Less than or equal to)

Example
console.log(5 === '5'); // false (strict comparison) console.log(5 == '5'); // true (loose comparison)

4. Logical Operators
Used to combine boolean values.

&& (Logical AND) || (Logical OR) ! (Logical NOT)

Example
let a = true; let b = false; console.log(a && b); // false console.log(a || b); // true

5. Bitwise Operators
Used to perform operations on binary representations.

& (AND) | (OR) ^ (XOR) ~ (NOT) << (Left shift)

(Right shift)

(Unsigned right shift)

Example:-
let bitwiseAnd = 5 & 3; // 1 (binary: 0101 & 0011 = 0001)

6. Ternary Operator
A shorthand for if...else statements.

Syntax
condition ? exprIfTrue : exprIfFalse;

Example
let age = 18; let canVote = age >= 18 ? "Yes" : "No"; // "Yes"

7. typeof Operator
Returns the type of a variable or expression.

Example
console.log(typeof 42); // "number" console.log(typeof 'Hello'); // "string"

8. Instanceof Operator
Checks if an object is an instance of a specific class or constructor.

Example
let date = new Date(); console.log(date instanceof Date); // true

Relational Operator
Relational operators in JavaScript are used to compare two values and determine their relationship. They evaluate to a boolean value (true or false). Here are the main relational operators:

Example
Equal to (==)
Strict Equal to (===)
Not Equal to (!=)
Strict Not Equal to (!==)
Greater Than (>)
Less Than (<)
Greater Than or Equal To (>=)
Less Than or Equal To (<=)
